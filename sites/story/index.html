    <p>Three little pigs after leaving momma need a new house. So the three pig went around and made their new homes.</p><br/>
    <p>The first little pig made a house of sticks. The second little pig made a house of hay to stay. The third little pig spent all day making a house of bricks</p><br/>
    <p>Then one day a wolf came to get some food. The wolf first tried to get into the stick house, the pig denied so the wolf huffed and puffed and blew the house down. The first little pig ran as fast as he could to the house of straw</p><br/>
    <p>Then the wolf went to the second little pig's house and knocked and the pigs denied so he huffed and puffed and blew the house down. The first two little pigs went to the third little pig's house</p><br/>
    <p>Then the wolf knocked on the house of bricks, and the pigs wouldn't let him in so he huffed and puffed but couldn't blow down the house, so he climbed up the chimney to get in but there way boiling water in the chimney so the wolf was cooked alive</p><br/>
