        <div class="content">
            <p>The reason weekend wednesday works is because of the fact that after tuesday most people are tired</p>
            <p>Also it makes mondays less painful because there isn't enough time to get used to sleep in late</p>
            <p>In the typical weekend saturday is regaining strength after the past 5 days of work</p>
            <p>With weekend wednesday you only need to restart from 2 days and can enjoy both days instead of one</p>
